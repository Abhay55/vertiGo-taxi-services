Amendments will be effective upon VERTIGO’s posting of such updated Terms at this location or the amended policies or supplemental terms on the applicable Service. Your continued access or use of the Services after such posting constitutes your consent to be bound by the Terms, as amended.\nOur collection and use of personal information in connection with the Services is as provided in VERTIGO’s Privacy Policy located at https://www.VERTIGO.com/legal.

Unless otherwise agreed by VERTIGO in a separate written agreement with you, the Services are made available solely for your personal, noncommercial use. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT VERTIGO DOES NOT PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION OR LOGISTICS SERVICES OR FUNCTION AS A TRANSPORTATION CARRIER AND THAT ALL SUCH TRANSPORTATION OR LOGISTICS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED BY INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY CONTRACTORS WHO ARE NOT EMPLOYED BY VERTIGO OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES.\nLICENSE.\nSubject to your compliance with these Terms, VERTIGO grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, revocable, non-transferrable license to: (i) access and use the Applications on your personal device solely in connection with your use of the Services; and (ii) access and use any content, information and related materials that may be made available through the Services, in each case solely for your personal, noncommercial use. Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by VERTIGO and VERTIGO’s licensors.\nRESTRICTIONS.\nYou may not: (i) remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices from any portion of the Services; (ii) reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license, lease, sell, resell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or otherwise exploit the Services except as expressly permitted by VERTIGO; (iii) decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble the Services except as may be permitted by applicable law; (iv) link to, mirror or frame any portion of the Services; (v) cause or launch any programs or scripts for the purpose of scraping, indexing, surveying, or otherwise data mining any portion of the Services or unduly burdening or hindering the operation and/or functionality of any aspect of the Services; or (vi) attempt to gain unauthorized access to or impair any aspect of the Services or its related systems or networks.\nTHIRD PARTY SERVICES AND CONTENT.\nThe Services may be made available or accessed in connection with third party services and content (including advertising) that VERTIGO does not control.

Your access to the Services using these devices is subject to terms set forth in the applicable third party beneficiary’s terms of service.\nOWNERSHIP.\nThe Services and all rights therein are and shall remain VERTIGO’s property or the property of VERTIGO’s licensors. Neither these Terms nor your use of the Services convey or grant to you any rights: (i) in or related to the Services except for the limited license granted above; or (ii) to use or reference in any manner VERTIGO’s company names, logos, product and service names, trademarks or services marks or those of VERTIGO’s licensors.\n3. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES\nUSER ACCOUNTS.\nIn order to use most aspects of the Services, you must register for and maintain an active personal user Services account (“Account”). You must be at least 18 years of age, or the age of legal majority in your jurisdiction (if different than 18), to obtain an Account. Account registration requires you to submit to VERTIGO certain personal information, such as your name, address, mobile phone number and age, as well as at least one valid payment method (either a credit card or accepted payment partner). You agree to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date information in your Account. Your failure to maintain accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account information, including having an invalid or expired payment method on file, may result in your inability to access and use the Services or VERTIGO’s termination of these Terms with you. You are responsible for all activity that occurs under your Account, and you agree to maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username and password at all times. Unless otherwise permitted by VERTIGO in writing, you may only possess one Account.\nUSER REQUIREMENTS AND CONDUCT.\nThe Service is not available for use by persons under the age of 18. You may not authorize third parties to use your Account, and you may not allow persons under the age of 18 to receive transportation or logistics services from Third Party Providers unless they are accompanied by you. You may not assign or otherwise transfer your Account to any other person or entity. You agree to comply with all applicable laws when using the Services, and you may only use the Services for lawful purposes (e.g., no transport of unlawful or hazardous materials). You will not, in your use of the Services, cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage, whether to the Third Party Provider or any other party. In certain instances you may be asked to provide proof of identity to access or use the Services, and you agree that you may be denied access to or use of the Services if you refuse to provide proof of identity.\nUSER PROVIDED CONTENT.\nVERTIGO may, in VERTIGO’s sole discretion, permit you from time to time to submit, upload, publish or otherwise make available to VERTIGO through the Services textual, audio, and/or visual content and information, including commentary and feedback related to the Services, initiation of support requests, and submission of entries for competitions and promotions (“User Content”). Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to VERTIGO, you grant VERTIGO a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and VERTIGO’s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.\nYou represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant VERTIGO the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor VERTIGO’s use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.\nYou agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by VERTIGO in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. VERTIGO may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at VERTIGO’s sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.\n4. PAYMENT\nYou understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges ”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, VERTIGO will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by VERTIGO. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. VERTIGO will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.\nAll Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by VERTIGO using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which VERTIGO will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that VERTIGO may, as the Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available\n");
